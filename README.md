## Algorithm-Learning
> Key Words: ACM, ICPC, Computer Program, Algorithm
<!-- > Motivation: I obtained a Silver in a 2018 Asian regional contest, and a Silver in CCSP-2019 final contest. I enjoy the programming moment, and hope that I can update this repo every week -_-. -->


This repo includes the basic and classic computer programming and algorithm.

Text Book: [Competitive Programmer’s Handbook (by Antti Laaksonen 2017)](textbook/antti_book.pdf)

Recommend an awesome website [OI Wiki](https://oi-wiki.org/), and a great ACM textbook [算法竞赛入门经典(第二版) (by Liu Rujia)](textbook/ACM_purple_lrj_book.pdf).


## Online Judges Platform

1. [Codeforce](https://codeforces.com/) is a competitive programming platform that hosts exhilarating contests for programmers around the world. These contests are open to everyone, and consistently attract thousands of participants per round.


2. [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/) is a vibrant hub where programmers learn, compete, and collaborate, all while solving computational challenges.


3. [HDU OJ](https://acm.hdu.edu.cn/) is a famous OJ platform in China. HDU OJ will host training contests every summer, and thousands of Chinese students actively take part in the training to learn, compete and collaborate. And, most of them will participate in the ACM ICPC contests later in the year.

4. [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems)

5. [vjudge](https://vjudge.net/article/524) A very good problem set for ACMer training program.
